/**
 * Theme CSS Variables
 * 
 * This file imports theme variables from the styles library.
 * These variables are used by all ui-components.
 * 
 * Note: CSS custom properties (CSS variables) can pierce through shadow DOM,
 * so these variables will be available to all web components as long as
 * this file or the styles library theme.css is loaded in the main application.
